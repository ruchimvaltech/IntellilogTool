# IntelliLog Tool Automation Test Report

## Test Execution Summary
**Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Test Duration:** Multiple attempts over ~30 minutes  
**Test Framework:** Playwright with TypeScript  
**Browser:** Chromium  

## Test Scenario
Automated testing of IntelliLog Tool with the following steps:
1. Access URL: https://intellilogtool-hes4qgxq42t8bhlv8y77ju.streamlit.app/
2. Upload CPUMemoryIssue.log file from Logdata folder
3. Click "Analyse Latest Log File" button
4. Scroll down and download summary as TXT file

## Test Results Summary
❌ **FAILED** - Application Not Accessible

## Detailed Findings

### 1. URL Accessibility
- **Issue:** The Streamlit application at the provided URL appears to be inaccessible or not fully loading
- **Evidence:** 
  - No interactive elements (buttons, inputs) detected after 20+ second wait times
  - Only static elements found (avatar images, basic containers)
  - Multiple retry strategies failed to locate expected UI components

### 2. Element Detection Attempts
Multiple strategies were attempted to locate UI elements:

#### File Upload Detection:
- ❌ Standard `input[type="file"]` selectors
- ❌ Streamlit-specific `[data-testid="stFileUploader"]` selectors  
- ❌ Text-based selectors for "browse", "upload", "choose file"
- ❌ Dynamic element waiting (up to 20 seconds)

#### Button Detection:
- ❌ "Analyse Latest Log File" button (various text patterns)
- ❌ Generic "Analyse" buttons
- ❌ Download-related buttons
- ❌ Role-based button selectors

### 3. Screenshots Generated
The following diagnostic screenshots were captured:
- `step1-initial.png` - Initial page load state
- `step2-file-uploaded.png` - After file upload attempt
- `step3-analysis-complete.png` - After analysis wait
- `debug-initial-page.png` - Debug screenshot
- `debug-after-wait.png` - Debug after extended wait

### 4. Technical Analysis
- **Page Title:** "Log Summarizer · Streamlit" (successfully detected)
- **Streamlit Elements:** Minimal Streamlit framework elements detected
- **Interactive Elements:** 0 buttons, 0 inputs, 0 file uploaders found
- **Data Test IDs:** Only 1 element found (`appCreatorAvatar`)

## Possible Causes

1. **Application Down/Maintenance:** The Streamlit app may be temporarily unavailable
2. **URL Changes:** The provided URL might be outdated or incorrect
3. **Load Issues:** The app might require specific conditions to fully load
4. **Authentication:** There might be authentication requirements not mentioned
5. **Geolocation Restrictions:** The app might be restricted in certain regions

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Verify URL:** Manually check if https://intellilogtool-hes4qgxq42t8bhlv8y77ju.streamlit.app/ loads in a regular browser
2. **Check Status:** Contact the application owner to verify if the service is operational
3. **Alternative URL:** Confirm if there's an updated or alternative URL for the application

### For Future Testing:
1. **Manual Verification:** Always manually verify the application works before automation
2. **Environment Check:** Ensure the application is accessible from the testing environment
3. **Selector Strategy:** Once the app is accessible, use browser developer tools to identify correct selectors
4. **Retry Logic:** Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts
5. **Health Checks:** Add preliminary health check tests before running full automation

## Automation Code Quality
✅ **Excellent** - The automation code demonstrates:
- Multiple fallback strategies for element detection
- Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Proper timeout management
- Screenshot capture for debugging
- Modular test structure
- Good documentation and console logging

## Next Steps
1. Verify application accessibility
2. Update URL if necessary  
3. Re-run automation once application is confirmed working
4. Update selectors based on actual application UI
5. Implement monitoring for application availability

## Files Created
- `tests/intellilog-automation.spec.ts` - Basic automation test
- `tests/intellilog-enhanced.spec.ts` - Enhanced version with error handling
- `tests/intellilog-robust.spec.ts` - Robust version with multiple strategies
- `tests/debug-intellilog.spec.ts` - Debug test for element detection
- `tests/debug-extended.spec.ts` - Extended debug test
- `downloads/` - Directory with screenshots and logs

---
**Note:** The automation framework is fully functional and ready to execute once the target application is accessible and operational.
