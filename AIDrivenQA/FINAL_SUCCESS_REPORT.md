# 🎉 IntelliLog Tool Automation - SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION

## 📊 **Final Test Results**
✅ **SUCCESS** - Automation is now fully functional!

**Test Execution Date:** August 7, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ PASSED  
**Duration:** ~47.4 seconds

## 🔧 **Key Breakthrough Discovery**

The critical issue was discovered: **The Streamlit application runs inside an iframe** with the title `"streamlitApp"`. This is why our initial attempts failed - we were looking for elements in the main page instead of inside the iframe.

### 🎯 **Correct Approach:**
```typescript
// Access the Streamlit iframe first
const streamlitFrame = page.locator('iframe[title="streamlitApp"]').contentFrame();

// Then interact with elements inside the iframe
await streamlitFrame.locator('input[type="file"]').setInputFiles(filePath);
```
